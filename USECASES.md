# Overview of use cases

As a: resident of a (e.g. qld) city

I want to: know about the air quality and current and future fires

So: I have an understanding of the quality of the air and what might affect the quality

Notes:
- basic air quality info displayed in an easy-to-understand way
- can link to other websites for more in-depth info or analysis


## understand election results

As a: voting citizen

I want to: see and read a clear description of how politicians are elected

So: I can understand the election and have confidence in the electoral process

Notes:
- This does not include showing much information about the politicians - that could be provided via links
- The explanation should be clear, succinct, and sharable on social media


## votes in parliament

As a: voting citizen

I want to: see the votes that take place

So: I know what is happening, and (where available) how individual politicians are voting

Notes:
- national and state/territory and local, where available
- both 'on the voices' votes and divisions
- link to the content of the relevant bills, speeches, documents, no need to replicate them
- consider how/if to include schedules / agendas of meetings, and minutes produced after meetings


## politician attendance

As a: voting citizen

I want to: know which politicians were present for votes in parliament

So: I can get a better idea of the voting patterns and intent of my representative

Notes:
- national and state/territory and local, where available
- attendance (and method - in-person, video), and reason for non-attendance (e.g. on leave)


## change in petition signatures

As a: person interested in how petitions relate to time and events

I want to: know how the signatures accrue over time

So: I can investigate any correlations or links between petitions and how (and maybe why) the signatures increase

Notes:
- This includes storing historical petitions, so petitions can be compared


## public transport service status

As a: public transport user

I want to: have easy access to the current status of public transport services

So: I can plan my travel and know about upcoming changes and issues with the services I use

Notes:
- include the date time and duration info
- include the service provider's assigned 'severity'
- include any service info, such as line name and event category
- the main goal here is to make the changes/events/incidents more interoperable - rss? ics?


## vehicle fuel locations and prices

As a: car owner

I want to: know the current fuel prices and where to get the fuel, as well as current price trends

So: I can access the fuel at a price I consider reasonable, and know how the fuel locations and prices are changing

Notes:
- not intending this to compete with existing 'find best fuel price' apps
- more for trends than current prices
- include locations (but not prices?) of electric vehicle charging stations
- maybe link to reviews / collections of EV station finder / price apps?


## river heights

As a: resident near a river

I want to: know past, current, and predicted river heights

So: I can understand the flood risk and prepare my home if it might flood

Notes:
- this is mainly because the BOM has some basic charts and data, but it is tough to navigate
- an overview, with a map, plus most recent (trends) and current status, would be most useful
- predictions can be sourced from warnings, if there are warnings, but this requires interpreting the text


## water quality and drinking water levels

As a: user of treated (drinking) and river/lake (for travel and leisure) water

I want to: understand the quality and level of the water

So: I can access my risk of being around river/lake water and any issues with the drinking water 

Notes:
- water quality assessments are available, but usually in excel/csv form
- the main goal here is to present a map with the recent and current levels
